# Open the database
sqlite3 market_data.db

# Once inside SQLite, you can run these useful commands:

# Show all tables
.tables

# Show the schema of the items table
.schema items

# Show the schema of the price_history table
.schema price_history

# Query examples:
# Get all items
SELECT * FROM items;

# Get the latest price history for a specific item
SELECT ph.*, i.name 
FROM price_history ph 
JOIN items i ON ph.item_id = i.id 
WHERE i.market_hash_name = 'your_item_name' 
ORDER BY ph.timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 10;

# Get items with their latest prices
SELECT i.name, i.market_hash_name, MAX(ph.price) as latest_price
FROM items i
LEFT JOIN price_history ph ON i.id = ph.item_id
GROUP BY i.id
ORDER BY latest_price DESC;

# Exit SQLite
