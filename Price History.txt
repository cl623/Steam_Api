Should You Load Price History for Every Item on the Main Page?
Cons:
The Steam /market/pricehistory endpoint is rate-limited and relatively slow.
Fetching price history for every item as you load/search would result in many API calls, slowing down your page and possibly getting you rate-limited or blocked.
It would also increase your server’s workload and response time.
Best Practice:
Do NOT fetch price history for every item on the main page.
Instead, fetch price history only when the user is specifically interested in an item (e.g., when viewing it in the cart or clicking a “View Price History” button).
Recommended Implementation: Show Price History in the Cart
When a user adds an item to the cart, show a “View Price History” button or tab for each item in the cart.
When the user clicks to view price history, make a request to your backend, which will call the Steam /market/pricehistory endpoint for that specific item.
Display the price history (e.g., as a chart) in the cart.
Implementation Plan
Backend:
Add a new Flask route: /api/pricehistory?appid=...&market_hash_name=...
This route will call the Steam API and return the price history data.
Frontend (Cart):
Add a “View Price History” button for each item in the cart.
When clicked, fetch the price history from your backend and display it (e.g., with a chart library like Chart.js).




When you manually test the Steam price history endpoint in your browser, you get a valid JSON response with price history for the item (e.g., "Bizarre Fox Mask").
But when your Flask backend makes the same request, it gets a 400 and [].
Why does this happen?
Steam often requires a valid session/cookie for some endpoints, especially for price history.
When you are logged in to Steam in your browser, you have cookies that authenticate you.
When your backend makes the request, it does not have these cookies, so Steam may block or limit the request.
How to Fix
Option 1: Use Your Steam Session Cookies
Get your Steam cookies from your browser (e.g., sessionid, steamLoginSecure).
Add them to your request headers in your Flask backend.
Example:
Apply to app.py
Replace YOUR_SESSIONID and YOUR_STEAMLOGINSECURE with your actual values from your browser.
Option 2: Use a Public Proxy or Scraper Service
Some services (like Steam market APIs or proxies) can fetch this data for you, but they may have rate limits or costs.
Option 3: Inform the User
If you want to keep your app public and not tie it to your own Steam account, you can show a message:
“Price history is only available when logged in to Steam.”
How to Implement Option 1 (Best for Personal Use)
Open your browser’s DevTools (F12) on a Steam page.
Go to the Application (Chrome) or Storage (Firefox) tab.
Find your cookies for steamcommunity.com:
sessionid
steamLoginSecure
Copy their values.
Update your Flask code:
Apply to app.py
Restart your Flask app and try again.
Security Note
Never share your Steam cookies publicly.
This method is best for personal/private use, not for public deployment.
Summary
Steam’s price history endpoint works in your browser because you are logged in.
Your backend requests are missing the required cookies.
Add your Steam session cookies to your backend request headers to get price history.

Let's use option 2. What are the pros and cons of this method? 

Great question! Here’s a clear breakdown of Option 2: Using a Public Proxy or Scraper Service for Steam Market price history:
Pros
1. No Need for Your Own Steam Credentials
You don’t have to expose or manage your personal Steam cookies or login.
Safer for public-facing apps or demos.
2. Easier for Multi-User/Public Use
Anyone can use your app without needing to supply their own Steam credentials.
No risk of leaking your own account/session.
3. Bypasses Steam’s Browser-Only Restrictions
Many proxies/scraper APIs are designed to work around Steam’s anti-bot measures.
They may handle cookies, rate limits, and captchas for you.
4. Potentially More Reliable for Bulk Data
Some services are built for scraping large amounts of data and may be more robust than a single user session.
Cons
1. Rate Limits and Reliability
Free proxies/services may have strict rate limits, downtime, or unreliable data.
Paid services can get expensive if you need a lot of requests.
2. Data Freshness and Completeness
Some proxies cache data, so you might not get the most up-to-date price history.
Some items may be missing or incomplete.
3. Trust and Security
You must trust the proxy/service not to tamper with or log your requests.
If the service is shut down or changes its API, your app will break.
4. Legal/Ethical Considerations
Scraping Steam may violate their terms of service.
Using a third-party service may also have its own terms and risks.
5. Less Control
You can’t control how the proxy fetches or parses the data.
If Steam changes their site, the proxy may break and you’ll have to wait for them to fix it.
